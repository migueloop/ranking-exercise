Get as close as you can to the image (without  the notes and arrows of course 😂)
Be the cleanest you can while coding.
Try to document the code as much as you can (JSDoc & Inline comments)
If you use any tool to preprocess or compile, document briefly the reason for incorporating these processors and explain how to run the required procedures in order to see the end result.
